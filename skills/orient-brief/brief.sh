# the row's brief and the board's live ORCHESTRATOR ACTIVE section. ALWAYS exits 0, because the skill
# loader aborts the whole skill on a non-zero exit; every failure prints a NO BRIEF / NO BANNER /
# FETCH FAILED line the session can act on instead.
# Accepted residual: the loader pastes the row into the injected command as text, so a row id holding a
# single quote could break out of its quoting before this script runs. Only the seat mints row ids, and
# the skill's `allowed-tools` makes any extra subcommand fail the permission check.
# Usage (by the skill): bash brief.sh <ROW>     Env: BRIEF_BRANCH overrides the default branch.
