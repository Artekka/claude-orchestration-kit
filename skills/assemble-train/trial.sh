# trial.sh (orchestration-kit, assemble-train): simulate merging a rider onto a base without touching any ref.
# Run as:  B=<base commit> R=<rider commit> bash trial.sh      (in the train's repo)
# Named variables only: the skill loader replaces positional tokens in a rendered skill with its arguments.
# Prints: the merge result (RC=0 clean, 1 conflict, with git's conflict messages), then for every file the
# RIDER changed (merge-base..R) which side's blob the merged tree holds:
#   RIDER   = the rider's blob landed            TRAIN = the base's blob kept (the rider's change did not land)
#   SAME    = the base already holds the rider's blob (cherry-picked, or the same change made twice)
#   NEITHER = a 3-way result: verify it by content (apply the rider's patch to the train's copy)
# Last, a SYNTH commit (parents B and R) to chain the next trial on:  B=<SYNTH> R=<next rider> bash trial.sh
# A rider that is already an ancestor of the base prints ALREADY-ON-TRAIN, and its SYNTH is the base itself.
