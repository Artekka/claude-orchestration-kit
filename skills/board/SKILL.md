name: board
description: Work the shared multi-session agent board — read it, claim a row, add rows under your session prefix, update status, announce resource windows, release fences, close rows. Use at the start of any substantial task, after finishing a chunk, and before deploying (DEPLOY slot claim). The board file is the live coordination surface between concurrent Claude sessions on this repo.

# board

Board path: `ORCHESTRATION.md` → Sessions (default `docs/orchestration/AGENT_BOARD.md`). The protocol table lives IN the board file — honor it exactly.

## Read (always first)

```
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main   # NOT `git pull --rebase` — sessions share .git/FETCH_HEAD and race on it
# "cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/main'" = a sibling's fetch won the lock; nothing rebased. Retry once:
git fetch origin || { sleep 2; git fetch origin; } && git rebase origin/main
# not a `for …; do git fetch && break; sleep 2; done && …` loop — it exits with sleep's 0 and rebases after every fetch failed
```

Read top to bottom: every open row's file fence is a hard no-edit zone for you. Check the top for an `ORCHESTRATOR ACTIVE` banner — if one stands, IDs/slots are single-allocator (see `/orchestration-kit:orchestrate` §1) and task intake routes through the orchestrator.

## Claim

1. Pick an OPEN row — then **verify it against the CODE** (OPEN is a hypothesis; rows rot) and treat its proposed fix as a hypothesis too.
2. Edit status → `CLAIMED <your tag>`; state your file fence.
3. **Commit + push BEFORE starting work:** `chore(orchestration): <tag> claims <row>`. An unpushed claim is not a claim.
4. Push rejected → fetch + rebase (above), re-read (your row may be gone), re-claim.

## New rows — YOUR prefix, never a shared counter

File `<tag>-1`, `<tag>-2` … numbered within your OWN session (LESSON 16). Never read the board's highest id and add one. Under an orchestrator banner, planned-work IDs are the orchestrator's; your prefix covers your mid-task discoveries.

## Slots + windows

- **DEPLOY slot:** claim in writing BEFORE running the deploy; release with the verified live version.
- **LOG slot:** claim before appending any milestone/log entry; the number is allocated inside the claim text (LESSON 17).
- **Resource windows:** announce gate runs, integration/container runs, deploys, and shared-daemon dev-stack boots BEFORE running them; mark the window CLOSED when done (LESSON 19).

## Writing the board in the shared checkout (every write)

The shared checkout's HEAD **and index** are shared by every session. Explicit staging protects your commit from others' files, not your staged file from THEIR commit.

```bash
[ "$(git symbolic-ref -q HEAD)" = refs/heads/main ] || { echo "shared checkout not on main — STOP, tell the seat"; exit 1; }
git diff HEAD --quiet || { echo "shared tree/index dirty — a sibling's hunk would ride your commit; wait"; exit 1; }
# …edit the board…
git add docs/orchestration/AGENT_BOARD.md && git commit -m "chore(orchestration): <tag> <what>"   # ONE command
git push origin main                                                                              # immediately; never HEAD:main
```
"nothing added to commit" + "Everything up-to-date" right after your write = a sibling's commit swept your hunk; confirm with `git log -1 -p`.

## Status, not narrative — and the archive

- A row carries: id · title · status · owner `[ref]` · fence · on-main SHA · verdict + literal gate line. Briefs, verdict transcripts, post-mortems go to the builder by message or to the log, and the board links to them. (A narrative board briefs its own verifiers.)
- Board past **~60 KB** → `cp` it verbatim to `docs/orchestration/archive/BOARD_ARCHIVE_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (suffix `b`, `c` … for a second archive that day), add a line to the board's archive table, rewrite the live board to status only, commit both.
- History lookup: `grep -n '<ROW-ID>' docs/orchestration/archive/BOARD_ARCHIVE_*.md | cut -c1-200`.

## Update / close

- Status transitions per the board's Statuses line; record the verify verdict and the REAL gate summary (literal pass line, never "green").
- On done: release the fence explicitly so other sessions can proceed.
- Every board edit is its own prompt commit — uncommitted board state is invisible and gets swept into someone else's commit.

## Fence discipline

Never edit inside another open row's fence; genuine need → coordinate via notes on both rows + sequential landing order, never by editing first. Keep fences as narrow as honest.
