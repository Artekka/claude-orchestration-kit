# Status HUD

A Claude Code mod that shows, in pixel-style terminal style, what every session is doing and how loaded the machine is.
It is project-agnostic: it knows nothing about any repo until you configure it.

It ships with the orchestration kit as an **optional** component: `/orchestration-kit:kit-init` asks whether to install it (default No), and you can add or remove it any time — just ask Claude.
This copy was renamed from the upstream HUD's `gameMode*` keys to `quietMode*` (and its slash command to `/hud quiet`) to match the kit's quiet mode; an install configured with the old keys must be reconfigured.

Two looks, one setting (`variant`):

- **band**: a framed band of up to 10 rows above the prompt. Host meters on the left, one row per session on the right, mode chips along the bottom.
- **pane**: a side pane about 60 columns wide with a half-block sprite header, bigger meters, a load graph, a clickable session list and the selected session's detail.

Only the sessions named in `showForNames` (default `Orca`, the kit's default seat; kit-init sets it to yours) draw it; every other session still runs the mod and writes its heartbeat, so the shown HUD lists all of them. `/hud band` or `/hud pane` in a hidden session shows it there until that session ends.

Switch while running with `/hud band`, `/hud pane` or `/hud off`. The choice is remembered across sessions. `/hud quiet` toggles the kit's quiet mode. `/hud` alone prints a one-line summary.

## What it shows

- **Every session**: name, account dot (blue = account 1, purple = account 2), context bar and size, busy/shell/idle glyph, and the last tool or prompt as the activity line.
  Colors: green below the amber mark, amber from it, red from the report mark. Every color has a second cue: `~` after the size at amber, `!` at red.
  A session that crosses the report mark **flashes red** for `flashSeconds`.
- **Host**: CPU load against the thread count (with sparkline), RAM, disks, GPU utilization and temperature, VRAM.
- **Windows commit limit** (WSL): amber at `commitWarnPct`, red at `commitCritPct`. This is a real failure mode: Windows hits its commit limit and stops the WSL VM while the Linux side looks fine, with nothing logged inside Linux.
- **Chips**: Quiet Mode (clickable when both commands are configured), commit warning, sessions over the report mark, load high, session count.

## How it works

Every session that runs the mod reports itself and reads everyone else, through plain files in the status directory (default `~/.claude-status-hud`):

| File | Written by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions/<id>.json` | each session, every `refreshSeconds` | name, model, account, context used and window, state, activity |
| `host.json` | whichever session finds it older than 5 s | load, RAM, disks, GPU, commit, history for the sparklines |

- **Privacy.** The activity line is the tool's own description (or just its name), never your prompt text, a raw command, a file path or a URL. The status directory is created `0700` and its files `0600`; a directory that already exists (say you point `statusDir` at a shared folder) keeps its mode.
- A session is **gone** after `staleSeconds` without a heartbeat and its file is deleted at twice that. A clean exit deletes its own file.
- **One writer for host metrics.** A session that finds `host.json` stale takes a `mkdir` lock (atomic), runs one shell script for `/proc/loadavg`, `nproc`, `/proc/meminfo`, `df` and `nvidia-smi`, writes the result via tmp file and `mv`, and releases. The others skip. The lock holds an owner token and its start time; only its owner releases it, and a lock older than 60 s (longer than the longest live hold, 25 s) is a dead writer's: one session wins an atomic rename of it and deletes it. Orphaned `.tmp` files are swept after `staleSeconds`.
- The Windows commit reading runs `commitCmd` (about a second) at most every `commitSeconds`.
- **Drawing reads state only.** A timer fills the state from the files; the band and pane never shell out or touch the disk when they draw.
- A session's name comes from its `--name` argument and its account from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, both read off the parent `claude` process once at start. Override with the `sessionName` option or the `CLAUDE_HUD_NAME` env var.

## Install

With the orchestration kit (recommended): run `/orchestration-kit:kit-init` and answer Yes to the Status HUD question, or ask Claude to "install the status HUD". That runs, for each account the team uses:

```bash
claude plugin install status-hud@artekka-kits --scope project
claude plugin configure status-hud@artekka-kits --values-stdin <<'JSON'
{ "showForNames": "<your seat name>" }
JSON
```

By hand, without the kit's marketplace:

```bash
# one session, for trying it
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/status-hud

# every session, without installing: add this to the env block of ~/.claude/settings.json
# (and of each extra account's settings.json, e.g. ~/.claude-acct2/settings.json)
CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS=/path/to/plugins/status-hud
```

The `env` route is a settings edit, so do it deliberately; nothing in the kit makes it for you.

## Configure

All options are `userConfig` fields, shown in `/config` and stored under `pluginConfigs` in settings. To set several at once without editing JSON by hand:

```bash
claude plugin configure status-hud@artekka-kits --values-stdin <<'JSON'
{
  "variant": "band",
  "contextAmberMark": "300000",
  "contextReportMark": "350000",
  "flashSeconds": "6",
  "commitWarnPct": "85",
  "commitCritPct": "95",
  "mounts": "/",
  "staleSeconds": "120",
  "showForNames": "Orca",
  "quietModeFlagFile": "~/.orchestration-kit/runtime/quiet-mode",
  "quietModeOnCmd": "bash scripts/quiet-mode.sh on",
  "quietModeOffCmd": "bash scripts/quiet-mode.sh off"
}
JSON
```

Installed from the kit's marketplace the id is `status-hud@artekka-kits`; loaded with `--plugin-dir` or `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS` it is `status-hud@inline`. A second account needs its own run: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-acct2 claude plugin configure ...` (kit-init does this for every logged-in `~/.claude-acctN`).

If you edit settings JSON by hand instead, write numbers as numbers (`"contextReportMark": 350000`): a string in a number field stops the module from loading.

The quiet-mode values above are the defaults: the flag file the kit's `scripts/quiet-mode.sh` writes (under `KIT_RUNTIME_DIR` if you set it, else `~/.orchestration-kit/runtime`), and its on and off commands, which run in the session's directory (your repo).

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `variant` | `band` | `band`, `pane` or `off`. `/hud` changes it at run time. |
| `contextAmberMark` | 300000 | Tokens at which a session turns amber. |
| `contextReportMark` | 350000 | Tokens at which it turns red and flashes. Raise or lower it to taste. |
| `flashSeconds` | 6 | Flash length after crossing the report mark. 0 turns the flash off. |
| `commitWarnPct` / `commitCritPct` | 85 / 95 | Windows commit amber and red levels. |
| `commitCmd` | PowerShell one-liner | Prints `<limitKB> <freeKB>`. Empty disables the commit reading (not on WSL). |
| `commitSeconds` | 30 | Minimum seconds between commit readings. |
| `mounts` | `/` | Comma-separated mount points for the disk meters. |
| `showForNames` | `Orca` | Comma-separated session names that draw the HUD (exact, case-sensitive). Empty shows it in every session. kit-init sets your seat. |
| `statusDir` | `~/.claude-status-hud` | Shared directory. All sessions must use the same one. |
| `sessionName` | (detected) | Override the detected session name. |
| `refreshSeconds` | 3 | Heartbeat and redraw interval. |
| `staleSeconds` | 120 | When a silent session counts as gone. |
| `cpuRedLoad` | 0 | Load at which CPU turns red. 0 means 90% of the thread count. |
| `quietModeFlagFile` | `~/.orchestration-kit/runtime/quiet-mode` | If this file exists, quiet mode is on (cheap check, preferred). A leading `~` means your home. |
| `quietModeStatusCmd` | (none) | Alternative, used when the flag file is empty: exit code 0 means on. |
| `quietModeOnCmd` / `quietModeOffCmd` | `bash scripts/quiet-mode.sh on` / `off` | Run by the Quiet Mode chip and `/hud quiet`. Both are needed for the chip to be clickable. |

The Quiet Mode chip is hidden unless a flag file or status command is configured. It is a button: click it while the band has focus (click the band, or ctrl+x then tab), or use `/hud quiet`.

## Develop

```bash
tsc -p .                              # type-check (the engine lays .claude-plugin/types when it loads the mod)
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin test .
npx tsx scripts/preview.ts band 180   # print the band for sample data; also: pane 60, band 100 10, band 180 10 1
```

Layout and logic are plain modules in `lib/`; `hooks/register.tsx` only wires them to the engine. Tests use fakes for files and processes, plus an engine-level mock world in `tests/world.ts`.

## Limits

- Known issue (accepted): the stale-lock takeover can in theory hit an ABA race: if a writer's lock is judged dead and renamed away at the same instant a new owner takes it, the new owner's run may be removed. The worst case is one missed host reading, since the next refresh simply retries.

- Terminal and desktop surfaces only (the engine raises the band there); other surfaces get nothing.
- The Windows commit reading needs WSL interop. On a machine without it, set `commitCmd` empty.
- A peer's context is visible only if that peer runs the mod too; a session without it is absent from the list.
