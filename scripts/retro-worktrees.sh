# A retiring session removes its MERGED worktrees (run by /retro, Step 4b). Ported from a project whose disk filled with
# hundreds of stale worktrees (ORCA301-7 b).
# Usage: scripts/retro-worktrees.sh --prefix <branch-prefix> [--dry-run]     (e.g. --prefix s5e307/)
# Candidates: worktrees (git worktree list --porcelain) whose branch starts with the prefix. A tree whose tip is not an
# ancestor of origin/main is kept (its commits are not on main yet). The rest go through worktree_removal_blocker
# (scripts/lib-builder-worktree.sh, the check seat-merge.sh uses): clean, no non-rebuildable ignored file, no commit beyond
# origin/main, no file changed in the last 30 min, no process cwd inside. Skipped silently: other prefixes, detached trees.
# The worktree this runs in is never removed. Never `--force`; branch refs stay, so no commit is lost.
# --prefix is REQUIRED and may not be empty: an empty prefix would match every worktree on the host.
# One removed/kept line per candidate, then "retro-worktrees: removed N, kept M" (--dry-run: "would remove N, kept M").
