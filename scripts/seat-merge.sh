#!/usr/bin/env bash
# seat-merge.sh — the seat's merge path: merge a READ-passed branch onto a fresh origin/main, run the project's checks on
# the MERGED tree, and push only when they are green. Ported from the Einherjar project, where 25 fix rounds hardened it;
# every project-specific part is a config hook (see CONFIG below).
#
#   scripts/seat-merge.sh <branch> <expected-sha> "<merge message>"      (run from a clean merge worktree)
#
# Why it exists: two branches that are each green alone can break the project together, and a merge pushed after running
# only SOME of the checks sends the red to main. This script runs the format check and every configured check on the tree
# that will actually be pushed, and refuses (exit 1, nothing pushed) otherwise.
#
# What is merged is origin/<branch> and NOTHING else: every worktree shares one ref store, so a local <branch> of the
# builder (stale, or ahead with unreviewed commits) is always there and must never be picked. <expected-sha> is the sha the
# verifier's READ passed; the script refuses when origin/<branch> is anywhere else, and prints the merged sha + subject.
#
# Steps: usage → not the shared checkout → yield to a waiting ticket (bounded) → per-worktree lock → formatter installed
# → no tracked changes → fetch → resolve origin/<branch>, compare to <expected-sha> → already in origin/main = "nothing to
# merge", exit 0 → detach at origin/main → `merge --no-ff` (an untracked file in the way and a conflict each get their own
# refusal) → format check → install + checks → push the CHECKED merge sha (`git push origin "$merged":main`, never `HEAD`:
# a commit made in this worktree after the check would ride along unchecked) → confirm `git branch -r --contains` lists
# origin/main → remove the builder's worktree when it is provably idle. Never forces: a lost race is a refusal, re-run it.
# Red or conflict → nothing is pushed. A conflict is aborted; after a red the merged HEAD stays detached for inspection (the
# last line says so and how to reset it).
#
# CONFIG (a hook is optional; the environment variable wins over the config file):
#   File: an unindented `seat_merge:` line in docs/orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md, then indented `key: value` lines:
#     format_cmd:   the format check, run on the merged tree. Default: `pnpm format:check` (or `npm run format:check`
#                   without a pnpm-lock.yaml) when package.json has a "format:check" script, else none (a note says so).
#                   Env SEAT_MERGE_FORMAT_CMD. The default needs node_modules/.bin/prettier in the worktree and is refused
#                   BEFORE git is touched without it; a configured command brings its own tool and is not asked for one.
#     install_cmd:  run once before the checks, only when at least one check applies (a merge worktree with a stale
#                   install would give a false green). Default none. Env SEAT_MERGE_INSTALL_CMD.
#     check:        repeatable: `name | globs | command`. `globs` = space-separated path patterns matched against the files
#                   the merge changes (`*` matches any path, `docs/*` a directory); `*` alone = every merge. The command
#                   runs in the worktree with SEAT_MERGE_TOUCHED (the changed paths, one per line), SEAT_MERGE_MERGED (the
#                   merge sha) and SEAT_MERGE_CHECK (the name). A red check is rerun ONCE alone (load flakes); red twice
#                   refuses. Env SEAT_MERGE_CHECKS: the same lines, newline-separated, replaces the file's.
#                   Use it for the test guards, for tests that read generated pages, for a stale-build check.
#     allowed_paths: space-separated path prefixes (default `docs/orchestration/ docs/timeline/build-log.md docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`).
#                   When the push loses a race to commits that touch ONLY these paths, the SAME merge is redone onto the
#                   new origin/main and pushed without re-running the checks (at most 3 times). Env SEAT_MERGE_ALLOWED_PATHS.
#     yield_max_s / yield_poll_s: see YIELD below (defaults 3600 / 5). Env SEAT_MERGE_YIELD_MAX_S / SEAT_MERGE_YIELD_POLL_S.
#     idle_minutes: a builder worktree with a file changed this recently is kept (default 30). Env SEAT_MERGE_IDLE_MINUTES.
# Env only: SEAT_MERGE_REPO (the directory to run in; a test seam), SEAT_MERGE_RUNTIME_DIR (default
#   $HOME/.orchestration-kit/runtime; the lock and the tickets live there, never inside the worktree),
#   SEAT_MERGE_ALLOW_SHARED_CHECKOUT=1 (skip the linked-worktree check; for tests that use plain clones).
#
# YIELD: before it takes its lock the script waits while a LIVE pusher holds a ticket, <runtime>/seat-merge/<tool>-<pid>.waiting
# (contents `<pid> <starttime>`; scripts/lib-waiting-tickets.sh). Back-to-back merges that keep the lock for long would
# otherwise starve a push that retries every 30 s. Bounded by yield_max_s: past it, warn and go on, so a stuck ticket can
# never deadlock the merge chain. A dead owner's ticket is ignored and removed.
