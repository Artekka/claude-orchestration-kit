# gate-throttle.sh (orchestration-kit): run a heavy command (your gate, a whole test suite) only when one of
# N host-wide slots is free, so several sessions on one machine do not run N full gates at once and flake
# on load. Usage, from inside YOUR worktree:
#   bash scripts/gate-throttle.sh <command> [args...]        e.g. bash scripts/gate-throttle.sh npm test
# Exit code = the command's exit code.
#
# Slots:     `gate_slots:` in the team block of docs/orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md (default 2);
#            GATE_SLOTS overrides it.
# Priority:  one extra slot for release/train gates. A command may take it only if its working directory
#            starts with a line of "$RT/gate-priority.txt" (one path prefix per line; the seat owns it).
#            The priority slot ignores the queue and the load check.
# Fair order: each waiter takes a numbered ticket; only the oldest LIVE waiter may try for a normal slot
#            (polling alone is not first-come-first-served: a gate once waited 1.5 h while later arrivals
#            took freed slots). A dead waiter's ticket is skipped and deleted.
# Load:      the head of the line takes a normal slot only while the 1-minute load average is below
#            GATE_MAX_LOAD (default 0.9 x CPU count). Unreadable load = admit.
# Quiet mode: while "$RT/quiet-mode" exists (scripts/quiet-mode.sh on), no NEW command starts; running
#            ones finish. GATE_IGNORE_QUIET=1 is the seat's escape for a hotfix gate; while quiet
#            mode is on it also skips the line, because the waiters ahead of it are parked.
# Runtime dir: $KIT_RUNTIME_DIR, default ~/.orchestration-kit/runtime. Not /tmp: a reboot wipes /tmp.
#            A lock file that survives a reboot is harmless, because flock locks are held by the kernel,
#            not by the file: the holder died with the machine, so the next command simply takes it.
# One slot per worktree: a throttle whose worktree (the git toplevel of its directory, else the directory) already holds a
#            slot or waits in the line is refused at once, exit 3, before it takes a ticket. GATE_ALLOW_SECOND_SLOT=1
#            is the seat's escape. Why: one session's parallel runs once held 2 of 3 slots for hours while 8 gates queued.
# Priority list: re-read on EVERY poll, each line in one canonical form (symlinks resolved; a trailing "/" means "inside
#            this directory, not the directory itself"), so a path the seat adds while a gate waits takes effect.
# Signals:   TERM/HUP stop the command's WHOLE process tree (TERM, then KILL after GATE_STOP_GRACE seconds, default 5, for
#            any process that ignored it); the throttle exits 143 / 129. Never `pkill -f`.
# Load:      tasks stuck in uninterruptible sleep (D state, e.g. a hung driver) use no CPU but count in loadavg; the
#            effective load is loadavg minus the tasks still in D state a second sample later (GATE_DSTATE_GAP).
# Workers:   the command gets GATE_WORKERS (a positive integer): CPUs / slots, held to this process's CPU mask, at least 2.
#            A test runner can read it (jest --maxWorkers, vitest, pytest -n). A GATE_WORKERS you set yourself wins.
# Deploy mode: while a gate that took the PRIORITY slot runs, (1) no NEW normal gate is admitted (it waits in line, with one
#            notice), and (2) every OTHER running throttled gate's process tree is confined to the first
#            GATE_DEPLOY_OTHERS_PCT (default 25) percent of the CPUs, at least 2, so the release gate gets the rest. Each process
#            gets back EXACTLY the mask it had before. Affinity, not nice: an unprivileged process cannot lower a nice value again,
#            and a crash would leave gates niced for good. Nothing is ever signaled, stopped or paused. State in
#            "$RT/deploy-mode/". Restore happens when the priority throttle exits (any signal TERM/INT/HUP included), from its
#            monitor when it dies without a trap (SIGKILL), and at the top of EVERY throttle start, so a killed release gate
#            cannot leave anything confined. A pid whose start time changed is never touched. Needs taskset(1)
#            (KIT_TASKSET_BIN names it); without it deploy mode is an admission hold only, with a note. quiet-mode.sh status
#            says whether it is on. Seams: KIT_DEPLOY_POLL (monitor period, default 5 s), KIT_DEPLOY_SWEEP_DELAY.
# Reuse check: `GATE_REUSE_CHECK` or `gate_reuse_check:` in the team block names a command asked BEFORE the throttle takes a
#            ticket, run as `<that command> <your command and args>`. Exit 0 = the tree already has a green record: its output
#            passes through and the throttle exits 0 without queueing or running anything. Any other exit = queue as usual. The
#            throttle has no flag of its own for this: a `--reuse-check` belongs to YOUR gate and, after the command, reaches it.
# Needs flock(1) (util-linux; macOS: `brew install flock`). Without it, it warns and runs unthrottled.
