#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sibling-shell.sh — the respawn loop a team terminal runs, so a recycle can happen in the SAME tab
# (orchestration-kit v0.7.0).
#
#   scripts/sibling-shell.sh <Name> [--mode M] --model M [--effort E] [prompt]
#       (prompt defaults to /orchestration-kit:orient; --mode is normal|accept-edits|auto)
#
# It runs `claude --name <Name> [mode flags] --model M [--effort E] <prompt>` as a CHILD, not via exec.
# When the child exits it looks for a hand-off file; if scripts/recycle-sibling.sh left one, it starts
# the next claude from it IN THE SAME TAB. No file = a plain /exit, and the wrapper exits so the tab
# closes as it always did. That is what makes a recycle in-place: recycle-sibling.sh writes the file,
# SIGTERMs only the old claude, and this loop does the launch. The order is kill-then-launch, which is
# safe because a recycle only ever runs after the session replied "retro complete": nothing the old
# context held is still needed.
# start-team.sh and recycle-sibling.sh open every new terminal tab running this wrapper, so a team
# started by the kit recycles in place from its first recycle on. A session started by hand (a bare
# `claude`) is not under a wrapper: its first recycle opens a new tab that runs one.
#
# HAND-OFF FILE  ${SIBLING_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.orchestration-kit/sessions}/<Name>.next
#   model=opus[1m]        required: the model is always explicit, never inherited
#   effort=high           optional; empty = no --effort flag
#   mode=auto             optional permission mode; absent = keep the current one
#   account_dir=/home/x/.claude-acctN   CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR for this launch; empty = the default account (unset)
#   prompt_b64=<base64>   the prompt, base64 on ONE line, so spaces, quotes, `;`, `$`, backticks and
#                         newlines survive with no shell parsing of the file at all
# The file is read with a plain line loop and never sourced or eval'd. Unknown keys, a malformed
# model/effort/mode or a missing model are REFUSED (the wrapper exits non-zero) rather than launched.
# The writer moves a finished temp file into place (tmp + mv), so this loop never sees a half file.
#
# CRASH-LOOP GUARD: if claude exits within SIBLING_MIN_RUN_SECS (default 5) twice in a row, the
# wrapper stops even if a hand-off is waiting, and says why. A bad model id or a logged-out account
# makes claude die at once; without this the loop would respin forever.
#
# Why `main` and the one-line `main "$@"; exit $?` at the bottom: bash reads a script a few bytes at
# a time while it runs, and this one lives for days. If the file is rewritten in place meanwhile
# (an editor, a checkout, a plugin update) bash would resume at its old byte offset in the NEW text.
# Parsing the whole loop as one function, and ending on a line that never returns to the file, rules
# that out.
#
# Env (tests set these): SIBLING_STATE_DIR, SIBLING_MIN_RUN_SECS. The child inherits this shell's
# stdin/stdout, which is why it is a foreground child (a `&` job would lose the terminal's stdin).
# Written for bash 3.2+ (macOS /bin/bash).
