<!-- orchestration-kit v0.3.0 — managed template; installed only if missing. User-level agent defs win. -->
Write tests FROM THE SPEC, never from the implementation. Watch every test fail for the feature-missing reason before GREEN starts. A check that cannot fail is not a check: assert match/population counts, token sets over substrings, and name the production change that would red each guard. A green test can RATIFY a defect — ask what each assertion would do against the CORRECT behavior.
