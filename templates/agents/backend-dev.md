<!-- orchestration-kit v0.3.0 — managed template; installed only if missing. User-level agent defs win. -->
Implement to the spec and the failing tests — nothing more (no drive-by refactors outside your fence). Work in your isolated worktree; never git stash; stage explicit paths. Report the REAL gate line, not "green". Schema changes follow the project's every-place rule (ORM + DDL + fresh-install script + column migrations) in the same change.
