# Project Orchestration Config — the overlay the kit's skills read

> Generic protocol lives in the kit (`orchestration-kit` plugin) and in `AGENT_BOARD.md`'s
> protocol table. THIS file holds everything project-specific. Every kit skill reads this

## Gate

The trusted fast verification command(s) and what a REAL pass looks like.

```
command:      <e.g. npm test | make check | cargo test --workspace>
pass proof:   <the literal summary line to assert, e.g. "Tests N passed / 0 failed" per suite —
               NEVER trust exit code alone; a chained clean run can mask an earlier failure>
never run:    <known-flaky full-suite commands and WHY, e.g. "full parallel test — container storm">
slow path:    <the exhaustive gate reserved for pre-deploy / before a train, and when it's required>
run from:     INSIDE your own worktree (a script that cd's to its own dir gates the tree it lives in)
```

## Change classes

Path patterns → risk class → extra gate + verifier escalation. Classes listed here as
high-risk get an AUTO independent verification before reconcile.

| Path pattern | Class | Extra gate | Verifier model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<e.g. src/engine/**>` | `<e.g. golden-critical>` | `<e.g. goldens byte-identical>` | strongest available |
| `<e.g. **/migrations/**, schema files>` | `migration` | `<boot/constraint check>` | strongest available |
| `<e.g. billing/auth paths>` | `economy` / `security` | `<value/path tracing>` | strongest available |
| everything else | `standard` | — | default strong model |

## Deploy

```
vehicle:      <the ONE command the seat runs for a wave train, e.g. make deploy | gh workflow run deploy>
exclusivity:  claim the DEPLOY slot on the board first; under an ORCHESTRATOR ACTIVE banner only the seat deploys
post-deploy:  <how to verify the deploy actually took, e.g. bundle marker / health URL>
```

## Locked

Constants, formulas, fixtures, and files that subagents must NEVER change without the
human's explicit sign-off in-context:

- `<e.g. balance constants in src/constants.ts>`
- `<e.g. golden fixtures>`

## Sessions

```
board path:     docs/orchestration/AGENT_BOARD.md
archive dir:    docs/orchestration/archive/   (BOARD_ARCHIVE_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md; archive past ~60 KB)
tag scheme:     <Name> [<ref>]  — Name = the terminal's `claude --name`, ref = from ListAgents
context marks:  1M window: self-report ~350K, hand over by ~400K · 200K window: ~120K / ~150K
                measure: python3 scripts/ctx-fill.py <uuid> --window 1m|200k   (never bytes ÷ 4)
start team:     bash scripts/start-team.sh [--dry-run] [--siblings N]   (skips names already running)
recycle:        bash scripts/recycle-sibling.sh <Name> [prompt] [--model M] [--effort E]   (prints commands + exits 2 where no terminal can be opened)
```

Team — `scripts/start-team.sh` and `scripts/recycle-sibling.sh` read this block (flags override
it; without it the defaults are seat `Orca`, siblings `Sib1`..`Sib2`, normal permissions). Keep
the `team:` line unindented and the keys indented. `permission_mode` is one of `normal`
(asks before risky actions), `accept-edits` (`--permission-mode acceptEdits`), `auto`
(`--permission-mode auto`); `start-team.sh --mode X` saves it here so recycles reuse it.
`worktrees` is `advised` (every session is instructed to work in its own git worktree; nothing
blocks it) or `enforced` (the kit's PreToolUse hook blocks file edits in the main checkout, except
`docs/orchestration/**`, the log and the status doc — needs the `.kit-hooks` marker). Keep
`advised` if your workflow deliberately shares one tree or file between agents.
`git_guard` is `off` or `on`. With `on` (and the `.kit-hooks` marker) the kit's PreToolUse Bash
hook blocks `git stash` (except `list`/`show`), `git add -A`/`--all`/`.`/`-u` without paths,
`git commit -a`/`--all` and `git pull --rebase`, telling Claude the safe alternative. Default:
`off` in solo mode; kit-init sets `on` when it starts a team (seat + siblings). A human can still
run those in their own terminal.
`model` / `effort` (both optional) set the default for every launch: `model` is `opus[1m]`, `sonnet[1m]`, `haiku` or a full model id (default `opus[1m]`), `effort` one of `low|medium|high|xhigh|max` (default: not passed). The launch scripts ALWAYS pass `--model` and never inherit the old session's, so a recycled session starts on the model its lane needs, not on whatever the terminal had. `--model` / `--effort` flags override the block; a bad value in the block is ignored with a warning, a bad flag exits 64. Per-lane choices: orchestrate skill, "Model per lane".
`terminal` picks how session windows open: `auto` (detect) or one of `wsl-wt`, `wsl-conhost`,
`tmux`, `tmux-detached`, `macos-iterm`, `macos-terminal`, `gitbash-cmd`, `linux-<emulator>`
(e.g. `linux-gnome-terminal`), `manual`. `bash scripts/start-team.sh --terminal list` shows
what is available on this machine; a `--terminal` flag overrides this key.
You can change any of this at any time — just ask Claude to change it.

```
team:
  seat:             Orca
  prefix:           Sib
  siblings:         2
  permission_mode:  normal
  worktrees:        advised
  git_guard:        off
  terminal:         auto
```

## Docs (institutional memory)

```
status doc:   docs/AI_CONTEXT.md           # what orient reads first: current state, deferred work
log:          docs/timeline/build-log.md   # append-only: Edit (append after the last lines), NEVER Write
memory:       Claude Code's auto-memory (~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/) — created by Claude Code; retro writes lessons there
```

## Validator seat

A sibling that NEVER builds — it only READs (verifies), re-reads fix rounds, verifies trains,
falsifies guards, and measures. Independent of every row because it built none of them.

```
validator:      <e.g. Check — or "none: any non-builder sibling READs">
lanes:          READ · re-read · train/merge verification · falsification · measurement
never:          build or fix rounds (a validator that builds loses its independence)
```

## Test hazards

Project-specific traps that make a red untrustworthy or a green vacuous:

- `<e.g. integration tests flake under container concurrency — run files one at a time>`
- `<e.g. piping test output masks the exit code — always read the real summary line>`
