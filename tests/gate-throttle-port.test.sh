# Tests for the gate-throttle.sh features ported from a project that has run the throttle daily (ORCA322-7):
#   unknown --option refusal · start-time stamps that survive load · the priority list re-read on every poll with one
#   canonical path form · ONE slot per worktree · a signal stops the command's whole tree · D-state-aware load ·
#   the worker cap handed to the command.
# The base behavior (slots, order, quiet mode, load, stale locks) stays in tests/gate-throttle.test.sh.
# Run: bash tests/gate-throttle-port.test.sh   (needs bash, git, flock, timeout; skips without flock)
