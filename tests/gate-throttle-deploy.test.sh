# Tests for gate-throttle.sh DEPLOY MODE and the reuse-check hook, ported from a project that has run them daily (ORCA322-9):
#   a priority gate that runs confines every OTHER running gate's tree to a CPU subset (taskset; affinity is reversible, nice is
#   not), holds new normal gates, never signals anyone, and gives each process back its OWN recorded mask on exit, on a dead owner
#   (monitor) and at the next throttle start (a SIGKILLed release gate cannot leave anything confined).
#   GATE_REUSE_CHECK / gate_reuse_check: ask first whether the tree already has a green record; a hit exits 0 without queueing.
# The base behavior stays in tests/gate-throttle.test.sh and tests/gate-throttle-port.test.sh.
# Run: bash tests/gate-throttle-deploy.test.sh   (needs bash, flock, timeout, taskset; the mask cases need 4+ CPUs)
