# Tests for the kit's disk cleanup (ORCA324-5 phase 1), ported from the project whose SSD filled (>=170 GB of old Docker images,
# worktrees and leftovers): scripts/retro-worktrees.sh, scripts/docker-cache-cap.sh, scripts/gate-disk-guard.sh and its wiring into
# scripts/gate-throttle.sh. Run: bash tests/disk-cleanup.test.sh
# Safety: every repo is a throwaway under mktemp (a bare "origin" plus a clone); `df` and `docker` are FAKE scripts, so no real
# disk, image or container is read or touched; HOME, git config and the runtime dir are temp; no network, no tmux.
