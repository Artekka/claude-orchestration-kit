# Distilled Lessons — why the protocol is shaped this way

Each rule below was paid for by a real incident. New lessons land here (with provenance)
and ship to every consuming project on the next kit upgrade — that propagation is the
kit's whole reason to exist.

## Coordination

1. **Claim before work; one owner per row; file fences are hard.**
   *Provenance:* three concurrent sessions partitioned ~15 workstreams in one evening with
   zero file collisions — only because every row carried an explicit file fence and claims
   were committed before work started (origin project, 2026-08-08).

2. **Worktree isolation for every implementation agent.** Concurrent sessions and their
   subagents never share main's working tree; non-isolated agents silently co-edit files.
   *Provenance:* origin-project memory `feedback_isolate_worktree_for_concurrent_sessions`.

3. **NEVER `git stash` inside a worktree agent.** Stash refs are SHARED across all
   worktrees of a repo; two agents stashing concurrently popped each other's WIP. Prove a
   RED state via `git commit` + `git reset --soft`, or copy files to a scratchpad.
   *Provenance:* origin-project B1/B2 stash collision, 2026-08-08.

4. **Sequential reconciles; exclusive deploy.** Land one worktree at a time onto main;
   claim the DEPLOY row before deploying. Parallel landings lose work; racing a deploy
   corrupts the cutover.
   *Provenance:* origin-project M376/M377 two-session coordination.

5. **Commit board edits immediately.** Uncommitted board state is invisible to other
   sessions and gets swept into someone else's commit.

6. **Stale status docs cause duplicate rebuilds.** A "BUILD pending" line for work that
   was actually finished on a branch nearly caused a full re-implementation. When work
   lands somewhere non-obvious (a held branch), the status doc must say so, with the
   branch name and the reason it's held.
   *Provenance:* origin-project ADR-0041 near-miss, 2026-08-08.

## Verification

7. **Independent verify at every hand-off edge.** A sibling implementation+test pair can
   confabulate the SAME wrong belief — wrong code + wrong test agree, and TDD shows green
   that means nothing. The verifier receives the contract only (spec + diff), never the
   implementer's reasoning, and judges against canonical ground truth (the spec/ADR/
   constants), never against a sibling's test.
   *Provenance:* origin-project memory `feedback_multiagent_false_green_trace_semantics`.

8. **The verifier reports; it never edits.** A verifier that "helpfully" fixes masks the
   drift it exists to catch.

9. **No vacuous green.** A check that found nothing wrong and a check that ran on nothing
   are indistinguishable unless you assert the match/population count — "0 failed" out of
   0 run is not a pass.

10. **Read the REAL pass line, unpiped.** Pipes mask exit codes; a background-task
    completion notification masks a failing exit; a process can print its pass summary and
    then crash in teardown. Assert the literal "N passed / 0 failed" summary AND a clean
    exit, from output you captured yourself.
    *Provenance:* origin-project memories `feedback_pipe_masks_exit_code`,
    `feedback_background_test_notification_masks_exit`.

11. **Gate red ≠ code red.** Know the project's infra-flake modes (e.g. one test
    container per file saturating Docker) and encode the trusted gate + the never-run
    commands in `ORCHESTRATION.md`. An untrustworthy red wastes every session's time.

12. **Gate green ≠ boots.** Unit-green says nothing about schema/seed/boot integrity;
    migrations need a boot or constraint check in the gate for their change class.
    *Provenance:* origin-project memory `feedback_gate_green_but_boot_crashloops`.

13. **Re-verify subagent claims at reconcile.** "Pre-existing failure", "flake", and
    "done" are claims, not facts, until the reconciler re-runs the named suite in
    isolation and sees it with its own eyes.
    *Provenance:* origin-project memory `feedback_verify_subagent_failure_claims`.

## Scope discipline

14. **Locked constants / spec-locked formulas need the human's sign-off.** Subagents get
    the list of locked items in their brief and treat it as read-only.
    *Provenance:* origin-project memory `feedback_guard_locked_constants_from_subagents`.

15. **The board is institutional memory at the hand-off grain.** Closed rows keep their
    verifier verdict, real gate lines, and released fences — the next session's context
    starts there.

## Orchestrated autonomy (harvest 2026-08-19 → 2026-08-21)

16. **Per-session row-ID prefixes — never a shared counter.** "Read the highest and add one"
    is a read-then-write with no lock; sessions append in different places so git never
    conflicts, both ids go live, and a grep returns two unrelated rows that look deliberate.
    Prefix = session tag (`O7-1`, `FQ-2`); collisions become impossible by construction.
    *Provenance:* six manual reconciliations in two days (origin project M416).

17. **Milestone/log numbers are allocated through a claimed LOG slot** (same shape as the
    DEPLOY slot). Any shared monotonic counter needs a single allocator while concurrent
    sessions run.

18. **A verify arc of DEVIATES → fix-roundtrip → delta-PASS is the system WORKING.** The
    verifier's findings are the record's most valuable content; a fully green suite can
    still carry spec drift. Roundtrip fixes land at the layer the finding names, falsified
    one-red-each.

19. **Announce resource windows on the board** — gate runs, integration/testcontainer runs,
    deploys, AND dev-stack boots on a shared daemon. A sibling's sweeper, deploy, or
    resource-hungry run is a killer for anything it can't see.

20. **After ANY interrupted cherry-pick / rebase sequence: count the picks.** A conflict
    abort can silently DROP a commit from the sequence; compare landed commits against the
    branch's commit list before declaring the landing complete.
    *Provenance:* a green branch's GREEN commit vanished from a landing mid-sequence
    (origin project, 2026-08-21); caught by counting the landed commits against the branch's
    intended list — the byte-diff against the branch tip was the repair's verification,
    not the detection.

21. **Mutation/falsification commands: one explicit target tree, stderr visible.** Never
    leave earlier path guesses in a compound command; never `2>/dev/null` anything that
    edits files; after restore, diff-verify EVERY tree the command string could have
    reached, not just the one the test reads. And a mutant you haven't diff-verified as
    APPLIED proves nothing.

22. **A change that ADDS test output needs one pass through the real gate stage** — gates
    that classify stage output by pattern make output part of the interface; a realistic
    fixture string in test logs can impersonate an infra-error signal and false-RED every
    session's gate. Capture loggers in tests (and assert they fired); never reword a
    fixture away from the real message to dodge a classifier.

23. **Doc-agent diffs are APPEND-ONLY and fact-checked line-by-line before commit.** A
    delegated log write once replaced a 32k-line institutional log with an 82-line stub,
    with fabricated details; `git diff` deletions must be zero for an append, and every
    factual claim is checked against what actually happened.

24. **Retro-before-clear is a HANDSHAKE.** `/clear` destroys unpersisted context; the retro
    converts it into memories and tied-off state. Order: retro order → the session's
    explicit "retro complete" → only then "safe to clear", one terminal at a time.

25. **No mid-orchestration `/compact`.** Context quality is load-bearing at hand-offs;
    compaction mid-arc loses exactly the correction/decision detail the next phase needs.
    Context pressure → the retro-before-clear handshake instead.

26. **Inserting a step into an ordered, PERSISTED sequence is a migration.** If a cursor
    stores a position and only resolves forward, a mid-list insertion strands everyone
    already past that index — precisely the users it was written to protect. Ship the
    backfill + a guard in the same change. Projects carrying such sequences should elevate
    this into their own CLAUDE.md.
    *Provenance:* a tutorial-step insertion soft-locked the project owner's own account
    (origin project TUT-30/31).

27. **Never expose user PII in public channels or shared artifacts** — usernames, emails,
    ids stay out of anything that leaves the project's private surface.

## Multi-session hardening (harvest 2026-08-22 → 2026-09-29)

28. **The INDEX is shared, not just the tree.** Explicit staging protects your commit from
    others' files, not your staged file from THEIR commit. Board writes in the shared
    checkout: HEAD guard → `git diff HEAD --quiet` → `git add <path> && git commit` as one
    command → push. "Nothing added" + "up-to-date" right after a write = you were swept.

29. **`git pull --rebase` races on the shared `.git/FETCH_HEAD`** ("Cannot rebase onto
    multiple branches"). Use `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`. A `cannot lock ref`
    exit is a lost fetch race — retry once; never wrap it in a loop that ends on `sleep`'s 0.

30. **Guard the shared checkout's HEAD before any write.** A sibling's failed `cd` can leave
    it detached on a trial branch; a later push of `HEAD:main` then ships ungated commits.
    Check `git symbolic-ref -q HEAD` = `refs/heads/main`; push `origin main`, never `HEAD:main`.

31. **Push a `merge --no-ff` immediately.** A plain rebase before the push linearizes the merge;
    the builder's SHAs never reach origin and a branch stacked on them conflicts later.

32. **Run the gate from inside your own worktree.** A gate script that `cd`s to its own
    directory gates the tree it lives in and prints a legitimate green for a tree you are not in.

33. **Siblings verify siblings — not subagents.** A subagent the seat spawns inherits the seat's
    framing; a peer session has its own context. Nobody verifies their own row, no mutual
    pairs, the verifier reports to the seat, and every verdict says DERIVED or
    CONSISTENCY-CHECKED — only the former is verification.

34. **A dedicated validator that never builds** is independent of every row by construction.
    Hand it READs, re-reads, train checks and falsification; never a build or fix round.

35. **A narrative board briefs its own verifiers.** Keep the board to status; briefs go to the
    builder by message; archive verbatim past ~60 KB and grep archives, never read them whole
    (an unreadable board is the same as no board).

36. **`ListAgents` is liveness, not readiness.** Terminal uptime survives `/clear`, so a fresh
    context and a spent one look identical. Rosters come from READY signals — otherwise the
    seat waits for siblings while siblings wait for the seat.

37. **Measure context; never estimate it.** Sum input + cache_read + cache_creation off the last
    assistant turn. `bytes ÷ 4` over-reports 30–60% with an unstable bias. The window is not in
    the transcript — read it from the session's own env block; a threshold calibrated for 1M
    never fires on a 200K session before it dies.

38. **Measure the right object.** Identify a session from an authoritative id, never "most
    recently modified". Checking a property of the wrong object raises confidence, not accuracy.

39. **Recycle launch-first, then SIGTERM.** Open the fresh session, wait until its process
    exists, then SIGTERM (not KILL) the old one — no seat is ever empty and the old transcript
    flushes. Only after "retro complete".

40. **All human approvals route through the seat.** Siblings stop and message the seat; the seat
    batches questions to the human in ONE terminal. Scattered prompts across terminals stall
    silently when nobody is watching that window.

41. **A suite nothing runs rots silently.** A fast DB-free gate is right per change, but some
    exhaustive sweep must run before trains or nightly — a change can be green on its own
    evidence and break a suite one directory over.

## Enumeration, evidence and honest claims (harvest 2026-08-28)

*One 12-hour orchestrated session, three sibling builders, two deploy trains, nine rows
shipped, two rows killed. Every lesson below came from a verifier finding, a sibling
correcting the orchestrator, or a sibling correcting itself.*

42. **The enumeration is the deliverable; the fix is the easy part.** Two independent rows
    failed identically the same day: each brief said "find every X" and then *illustrated*
    with three examples, and each builder fixed exactly those three. Independent
    re-enumeration found **eight** and **thirteen**. An illustration placed inside a
    requirement gets read AS the requirement. Name the enumeration as the artifact you
    want, and have the verifier rebuild it from scratch rather than check the builder's.
    *Provenance:* origin project — one row guarded 3 of 8 sites, another fixed 6 of 19 comments.

43. **A term-sweep converges only when every hit gets a written verdict.** Iterative
    "search and fix" rounds do not converge: round 1 found 9, round 2 fixed 6, round 3
    found 11 more. The cause is **not** vocabulary — the searches were fine. A grep over a
    large repo returns mostly noise, so the reader **unconsciously filters by plausibility**
    and a hit in a file that looks like someone else's area is skipped without a decision
    being made. Forcing a typed verdict per hit removes the filter, because "unrelated"
    must be *written* rather than assumed. Generalises to any audit-by-grep.

44. **When a fact is documented more than once, fixing ONE copy makes the others harder to
    find** — the fixed copy stops matching your grep and reads as done. Work twin-first:
    find a poison case, look for its bleed twin immediately; fix a mirror, fix its source.
    *Provenance:* one type file carried the same rider doc **four** times; a round whose
    stated purpose was "I fixed one half and left the twin" then fixed the wrong pair.

45. **A component test cannot see a regime that never mounts the component.** A feature
    shipped fully working — and absent on the one device/breakpoint the original reporter
    used — because a different component is substituted there. All its tests rendered the
    component directly. Pin the **composition** that chooses the component, and assert the
    regime is actually active so the test cannot pass by falling through to the other path.

46. **A guard that compares NAMES cannot see TYPES.** An entire family of drift guards
    compared key sets; flipping a field's declared type in the *canonical schema* left the
    dedicated drift guard green at 47/47. The only backstop was the compiler, and only
    *incidentally* — one file built typed literals while its neighbour used a cast. Decide
    explicitly whether a guard covers types, and write down which backstop you are relying
    on. Relying on one without knowing it is the failure.

47. **A restore check must assert TWO things: tree clean AND the fix still present.** A
    mutation-restore run against a baseline that never carried the fix is a **delete**, not
    a restore — and it prints `nothing to commit, working tree clean` plus a GREEN gate on
    the *pre-fix* SHA. Clean status alone cannot distinguish restored from deleted. Always
    commit GREEN before mutating.

48. **A mutant that reds for the wrong reason is not evidence.** A "mutant" that *inserted*
    a duplicate step rather than *relocating* one produced a red — but proved only
    sensitivity to placement, not that the guard catches the reorder it was written for.
    Diff-verify every mutant; a red you wanted is the easiest thing in the world to accept.

49. **Report the non-findings.** An audit that finds a defect in everything it inspects is
    usually an audit performing thoroughness — the useful output is *which* items were wrong
    and *why the others were not*. For a sweep, the negative results are half the
    deliverable: "your two hypotheses are falsified across 39 suites" is what lets an
    orchestrator ship without hedging.

50. **Propose an omission with the evidence that makes it safe, not the conclusion.** "I
    skipped the integration re-run — here is the diff proving nothing in those paths
    changed" is a thirty-second decision. "Should be fine" costs a full re-run.

51. **A test file that overstates its own coverage is worse than a missing test, because
    the next reader stops looking.** A coverage claim is a claim: it needs the same evidence
    as a behavioural one. *Provenance:* a header fixed an over-claim about code scope and
    introduced a fresh one about test coverage **in the same edit** — the tidy sentence
    arrives first, and repairing a claim feels careful enough to skip checking the new one.

52. **The hedge is the untidy part, and a write-up wants a clean rule — whoever is writing.**
    An orchestrator turned a builder's "I ran no sweep" into "patience saved a sibling's
    run," and its "a small piece of evidence" into "a natural experiment." A builder turned
    "three of six sites guarded" into "the state is unreachable." **The self-inflicted case
    is harder to catch, because there is no second party whose qualifier you notice yourself
    dropping.** When a builder qualifies a claim, the qualifier IS part of the finding.

53. **Sweeps run from a SHA-pinned worktree, and you must replay your scoping patterns
    against the full file list before claiming coverage.** A shared checkout moves under a
    long sweep as siblings commit, making chunks incomparable and attribution worthless.
    And scoped chunks silently drop anything the patterns miss — one suite matched no chunk
    pattern and had never run; the report would have said "149/149" having run 148. **The
    omission is invisible from inside the chunking.**

54. **A standing instruction that a tool violates automatically is not a standing
    instruction.** "Don't clean the shared containers" was unachievable, because the gate
    invokes that cleanup at stage 1. The fix is a knob (an env var raising the liveness
    floor), not a rule. Corollary: **"I didn't run X" is not the same claim as "X didn't
    run"** — report on the tooling's behaviour, not only your own actions.

55. **Couple two changes into one train when the INTERMEDIATE state is worse than either
    endpoint** — not merely because they are related. Shipping an ordering fix without its
    replay-parity companion would have released a version whose own fix made replays lie.

56. **Memory recall runs on the description, not the body — check what a description is
    retrievable BY, not just whether it is correct.** An accurate, indexed, week-old memory
    answered a question three sessions had; none found it, because its description named the
    *subsystem* and never the *tool everyone runs*. **A memory retrievable only by people
    already thinking about its topic is retrievable mainly by people who don't need it.**
    This is a writing-time discipline. The wrong conclusion is "write more memories."

57. **Knowing a rule does not prevent the failure it describes.** A builder cited the
    restore-was-a-delete rule to the orchestrator hours before walking into it. Recall is
    not the bottleneck; *applying a rule while inside the situation it describes* is a
    separate skill. Build the check into the procedure rather than trusting recall.

58. **Killing a row on zero population is a good outcome, not a wasted afternoon.** Two rows
    died that way in one session — one because a backfill described in the *future tense* had
    actually shipped five weeks earlier, so an audit believed the comment over the data.
    Require the population count *before* the build, and say "zero" out loud so nobody
    re-files it.

59. **Fail-open vs fail-closed is the load-bearing property of any client-side guard.** A
    disable derived from data that may not have loaded must degrade to *enabled* — the
    server's refusal is the real guard. A false disable silently denies a legitimate action
    with no error and no recourse, which is far worse than the dead click it replaced.

60. **A guard that cries wolf gets deleted.** Measure a marker/heuristic set against the real
    corpus before shipping it: a first-choice marker matched three files, two of which were
    unrelated. Precision is what keeps a guard alive long enough to catch anything.
