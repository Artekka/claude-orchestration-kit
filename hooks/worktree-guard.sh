# enforcement. Blocks file edits in the repo's MAIN checkout so every session works in its own
# linked worktree.
#
# NO-OP (exit 0, no output) unless ALL hold:
#   - the target file's repo carries the opt-in marker docs/orchestration/.kit-hooks;
#   - docs/orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md says `worktrees: enforced` (default is `advised`);
#   - the file resolves inside the MAIN worktree (first entry of `git worktree list`), not a linked one;
#   - the file is not allowlisted: docs/orchestration/**, the log and the status doc (paths from
#     ORCHESTRATION.md -> Docs; defaults docs/timeline/build-log.md, docs/AI_CONTEXT.md). Those are
#     edited in place and committed within seconds by design.
# Anything unparseable, or outside a git repo, is allowed. Deliberately no set -e: a hook must never
# break a tool call. No network; two git calls at most.
